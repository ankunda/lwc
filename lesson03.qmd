## Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about one of the most fundamental
concepts in computer science: algorithms.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
An **algorithm** is a detailed sequence of steps that describes how to solve
a problem or accomplish some task.
:::

First, consider the process of identifying problems and their possible
solutions, and breaking those solutions down into a sequence of steps.
One way to do this is via simple to-do lists.  Consider the problem of
getting to class in the morning.  Assume that you have just woken up
(that is, after you hit the snooze button a good dozen or so times).
What steps did you take to prepare and get to class?  A possible list of
steps is:

```default
get out of bed
brush teeth
take shower
get dressed
eat breakfast
grab book-bag
walk/bike/drive to class
```

This to-do list is actually a useful way to tell someone who didn't know
what to do in the morning to prepare to get to class, what to do.

Another example of a problem is that of baking an apple pie.  What would
a to-do list that would show someone who didn't know how to bake an
apple pie look like?  Could there be multiple ways of baking apple pie?
If so, how can we determine which one is the *best*?  Truly, this is
subjective; however, the idea of picking a best solution is one that is
required in computer science.

A possible solution to baking an apple pie as a to-do list may look like
this:

```default
make the dough
make the apple goop
combine the two
bake the dough with the goop
eat hot apple pie (with vanilla ice cream, of course)
```

What does an algorithm that describes how to bake apple pie in the
*best* manner mean?  Is it the algorithm that takes the shortest time to
produce hot apple pie?  Is it the algorithm that uses the fewest
ingredients?  Is it the algorithm that makes less of a mess in the
kitchen and therefore requires less cleanup?  These questions are
designed to illustrate that the notion of best algorithm is many times
quite subjective and does not always have a definite (or even a single)
answer.  However, the comparison of algorithms numerically to show the
performance of one against another is quite important in computer
science.  This will help in determining if one is better than another,
with the end goal being to identify a best algorithm.

Does a wrong algorithm for producing apple pie exist?  What solutions or
algorithms will not work?  What happens if a person uses blueberries
instead of apples?  Is the original problem of baking an apple pie
solved then?

## Problem statements: wrong vs. right algorithms

It is important to define standard ways of representing problems so that
anyone who reads about a problem can understand what it actually is.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **problem statement** is a formal way of defining a problem that contains
a description of the conditions at the start of the problem solving
process (also known as inputs), and a description of the valid solutions
(also referred to as outputs).
:::

For example, if a problem was to add three numbers and produce the sum,
what would the inputs be?  The answer, of course, is the three numbers!
What would the output be?  Clearly, the sum of those three numbers.  If
a problem was to determine the amount of income tax owed this year, what
would the inputs be?  Your income.  And the output?  The amount of tax
owed this year.  The following figure illustrates the sum example
(generally on the left, and specific to the sum of three numbers on the
right):

![](images/Lesson03-01.png){fig-align="center"}

Consider the *producing apple pie* problem.  What would the possible
inputs for the algorithm be?  What would its valid (or correct)
output(s) be?  One way of telling if an algorithm is correct is whether
or not it produces the valid output defined in the problem statement.
If an algorithm produces blueberry pie when the output statement stated
that it was required to produce apple pie, then that algorithm is a
wrong solution.  On the other hand, if the output is an apple pie (even
if the algorithm instructs you to throw away your ingredients and then
buy an apple pie from the grocery store), then that algorithm is
technically correct (even though it may not be very *efficient*).

## Step breakdown and control flow

Consider the get to class algorithm.  It consisted of steps such as
brush teeth, get dressed, and eat breakfast.  Some of these steps can
actually be defined as problems of their own, which themselves require
different algorithms in order to be successfully completed.  What this
means is that some of these steps can be broken down into their own
algorithms with a separate to-do list.  We call these sub-steps.  A
possible algorithm for the problem of getting dressed is:

```default
put on underwear
put on shorts
put on shirt
put on socks
put on shoes
```

This illustrates that we can zoom in to any step in an algorithm and
break it down into a series of smaller steps.  Note that it is possible
to arrive at a trivial step that does not require any smaller steps or
that does not have a simpler way to describe it.

So what should be done to our original get to class algorithm?  Should
getting dressed be replaced with the five new sub-steps identified
above?  Is the overall solution more correct or less correct if we do
that?  In the end, both solutions work and neither is specifically
better than the other.  It all depends on the desired level of detail.
If the person for whom the algorithm was intended for knew how to get
dressed, then a separate algorithm to explain that would not be needed.
However, if the person didn't know how to get dressed, then these
sub-steps would be very important.

Let's go back to the *producing apple pie* problem.  What do you think
would happen if the order of the steps was changed in the proposed
solution?  What if the raw ingredients used to make the dough and goop
were baked *before* putting them together?  In this case, there would be a
very messy oven instead of an apple pie.  What if the apple goop was
made before making the dough?  In this case, apple pie would still be
the delicious result.  There are times when the order in which the steps
of an algorithm are carried out matters a lot and other cases when it
doesn't matter as much.

Consider the *get to class* algorithm again.  What would happen if the
order of the steps was changed?  Imagine getting dressed before taking a
shower.  Imagine walking/biking/driving to class before getting dressed.
Let's not.  Could a shower be taken before brushing teeth?  Could
breakfast be eaten before brushing teeth?

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Control flow** is the order in which the instructions in an algorithm
are evaluated or executed.
:::

In the examples considered so far, the control flow of algorithms has
been the order in which the steps were listed.  Each step is evaluated
or performed until it is complete, and then we move on to the next step.
Completing all the steps completes the to-do list, thereby completing
the algorithm.  Numbering the items listed in a to-do lists is an easy
way of detailing the order in which the steps should be completed.  A
possible numbered solution to the *get to class* algorithm is:

```default
1. get out of bed
2. brush teeth
3. take shower
4. get dressed
5. eat breakfast
6. grab backpack
7. walk/bike/drive to class
```

We say that *flow of control* begins at step 1, flows to step 2, then to
step 3, and so on.  This means that step 1 is completed first before
attempting step 2.  Step 5 should not be done before step 4 is
completed.

What about the *get to class* algorithm in which separate sub-steps for
*get dressed* were specified (step 4 in the algorithm above)?  To combine
the two algorithms, numbers can be assigned to the steps in the *get
dressed* algorithm to show the order in which they will be executed in
*relation* to the *get to class* algorithm – which will now look like this:

```default
1. get out of bed
2. brush teeth
3. take shower
4. get dressed
10. eat breakfast
11. grab backpack
12. walk/bike/drive to class
```

The get dressed algorithm will now look like this:

```default
5. put on underwear
6. put on shorts
7. put on shirt
8. put on socks
9. put on shoes
```

Notice how steps 1 through 4 of the go to class algorithm are the same
and done in the same order.  However, we shift the flow of control to
the get dressed algorithm which used to be step 5 in the original.  We
have to execute the get dressed step (meaning its sub-steps) completely
before proceeding to the eat breakfast step.  However, the get dressed
step consists of five sub-steps, and so we number those steps before
continuing to the eat breakfast step.  This means that the first
sub-step in the get dressed algorithm is step 5.  We have to complete
the get dressed algorithm before returning to the get to class
algorithm.  Thus, the eat breakfast step becomes step 10 since the last
step of the get dressed algorithm is step 9.  The entire algorithm ends
when we execute the last step of the get to class algorithm, which is
step 12.

## Flowcharts

Up to this point, to-do lists have been used to represent algorithms.
There are other ways of representing algorithms, however, and one of
them is by using flowcharts.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **flowchart** is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, listing
steps with various blocks and flow with arrows.
:::

Flowcharts are made up of different types of blocks, each of a different
shape.  The shapes correspond to different kinds of statements or types
of item.  Flowcharts use arrows to show the direction of execution of a
given algorithm.  An arrow leading from a block A to a block B means
that A is executed before B.

To symbolize where the algorithm starts and ends, we have a special kind
of block called the **terminal block**.  Terminal blocks are oval in shape
and identify where an algorithm starts and where it ends.  The start
block will always have one arrow leading out of it to the next block to
be executed, and the stop block will always have at least one arrow
leading into it from some previous block.  Here is what a terminal block
looks like:

![Terminal block](images/Lesson03-02.png){fig-align="center"}

A **process block** represents statements in which some action is performed.
It is shaped like a rectangle.  Typically, this block will have one
arrow leading into it from a block that was executed before.  It will
also have an arrow leading out of it to the block that should be
executed next.  Here is what a process block looks like:

![Process block](images/Lesson03-03.png){fig-align="center"}

An input/output block is shaped like a parallelogram.  These blocks are
used whenever an algorithm requires an input or produces an output.
Similar to the process block, this block will have an arrow leading to
it from a previous block, and an arrow leading out of it to the next
block.  Here is what an input/output block looks like:

![Input/Output block](images/Lesson03-04.png){fig-align="center"}

Here is a possible flowchart that represents the solution to the get
dressed algorithm:

![](images/Lesson03-05.png){fig-align="center"}

Are there any weaknesses with this algorithm?  Will it always work and
produce the desired output?  For example, will it work if someone
already has underwear on?  The current algorithm would force the person
already wearing underwear to put on a second one.  What would happen if
the shirt they found was dirty, but they wanted to wear clean clothes
instead?  This algorithm would force the person to wear the dirty
clothes.

These are examples of scenarios that call for *decisions* to be made and
instructions to be decided on that are executed based on answers to
simple questions.  For example, skipping the *put on underwear* step would
be useful if the person already had underwear on.  Perhaps adding a step
*find clean shirt* to the algorithm would handle the case that an original
shirt is dirty.

It is difficult to handle these decisions in a traditional to-do list,
but flowcharts deal with them in a pretty neat way by using **decision
blocks**.  Decision blocks are diamond-shaped and typically contain a
question with a yes or no answer.  Similar to the previous blocks, the
decision block will have one arrow leading into it from the preceding
block.  However, decision blocks can have two arrows leading out that go
to two different blocks.  One of those blocks is executed if the answer
to the question posed in the decision block is *yes*, and the other block
is executed if the answer is *no*.  Here is what a decision block looks
like:

![Decision block](images/Lesson03-06.png){fig-align="center"}

Let's look at an improved flowchart for the get dressed algorithm that
has a decision block.  A possible solution is:

![](images/Lesson03-07.png){fig-align="center"}

One of the great things about decision blocks (and flowcharts in
general) is that you can have different control flows based on decisions
made by the algorithm.  The algorithm doesn't always have to behave the
same way and can actually change its behavior based on what is happening
during its execution.  The algorithm designer, however, has to think up
all possible scenarios and cater for them when designing an algorithm.

::: {.callout-important title="Activity" collapse=true}
Design a flowchart for the *eat breakfast* algorithm.  This time, add a
decision block with the question *am I satisfied?* in an appropriate
position, such that the algorithm will always ensure that the person
eating breakfast only stops eating once satisfied.
:::

## Repetition

You may have observed from the eat breakfast flowchart that it is
possible to use decision blocks to repeat a task an indefinite number of
times.  Repetition is a feature of many algorithms.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Repetition** is the repeating of a task (or tasks) over and over
again.  It is accompanied by a decision/condition that controls when the
repetition ends.  This is sometimes referred to as **iterating**, and each
loop that is repeated is referred to as an **iteration**.
:::

Sometimes an algorithm designer will know how many times to repeat a
certain task (i.e., how many iterations are needed).  For this reason,
there are many different types of repetition.  Some repeat while a
condition exists (we formally call this a **while** loop); some repeat until
a condition exists (we formally call this a **repeat-until** loop); some
repeat at least once, while a condition exists (we formally call this a
**do-while** loop); and some repeat a fixed or known number of times (we
formally call this a **repeat-n** loop or a **for** loop, depending on the
programming language used).  Flowcharts make the process of
repetition easy because connecting arrows can easily be placed to go
back to an earlier task.

For the next task, let's design an algorithm that finds and displays all
the prime numbers that are less than 10.  Listing all of the prime
numbers that are less than 10 is a fairly easy task.  However, what
about listing all the prime numbers that are less than 100?  What about
those that are less than 1,000?  Or 10,000?  As the number gets larger,
it becomes much more complicated.  This is why designing an algorithm
that a computer could execute would be beneficial.  Such an algorithm
would calculate all of the required prime numbers faster than we could
calculate them on our own.

::: {.callout-note title="Did you know"}
In algorithms where a certain task is repeated, it is often necessary to
keep track of how many times it has been completed.  This is done by
declaring and updating what is referred to as a **variable**.  Think of a
variable as a container with a name in which we store any piece of data,
potentially change it, observe it, and/or compare it with another piece
of data as the algorithm is executed.

In the case of repetition, a variable is typically used to represent a
number showing how many times a task has been completed.  The variable
can be called any name we want (the name could be a single letter such
as x or n, or even a long word such as
*theVariableStoringTheValueOfOurCounter*).  The variable is typically
initialized to 0 and is increased by 1 every time a task is completed.
When the entire algorithm terminates, the variable will contain the
total number of times the task was completed.
:::

The design of an algorithm that displays all of the prime numbers that
are less than 10 requires defining what it means for a number to be
prime.  Formally, a number is prime if it is only evenly divisible by
one and itself.  For example, 5 is prime but 4 is not (since it is also
evenly divisible by 2).  The only even prime number is 2.

To simplify the process of designing the algorithm, let's define a
variable, n, to be used to specify the current prime number candidate.
Let's also define a *magic* step (called *is n prime*) that will be used to
determine whether *n* is prime (i.e., let's not do this manually but
assume that the question can be asked and an answer provided in a single
step).  A possible algorithm as a flowchart is:

![](images/Lesson03-08.png){fig-align="center"}

Notice that in the algorithm above, *is n prime* is repeated for every
number (2 through 9 – which is a total of 8 times).  If the conditions
of the algorithm were changed to find all of the prime numbers below
100, *is n prime* would be repeated for every number from 2 through 99 (a
total of 98 times).  This algorithm isn't the most *efficient* algorithm,
but it gets the job done.

Sometimes the algorithm designer does not know how many times a process
is going to be repeated.  In such cases, a condition that is needed to
be satisfied before the repetition is ended will have to be specified.
The statement would then be repeated until that condition is reached.
For example, what would an algorithm for stirring sugar into a cup of
coffee look like?  Would it require stirring five times?  10 times?  100
times?  There is no way to tell ahead of time how many times one would
have to stir to get the sugar dissolved.  However, we know that the
stirring should go on while the sugar is not completely dissolved.  A
possible solution to this is:

![](images/Lesson03-09.png){fig-align="center"}

## Efficiency and runtime

It is sometimes useful to measure and predict the time a computer takes
to execute an algorithm.  This can help us to compare several solutions
to a problem and pick the fastest one, for example.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Runtime** is the time that a computer takes to execute an algorithm.
:::

Most of the algorithms that we have previously considered execute all of
their statements once.  As a result, they would not take long to be
executed by a typical computer (i.e., their runtime would be low).
However, algorithms that require repetition have a longer runtime.
Consider the *find all prime numbers* algorithm.  If it was adjusted to
find all the prime numbers below 100, it would take considerably longer
than if it was set to find all the prime numbers below 10.  It would
take even longer to find all the prime numbers below 1,000.  This is
because the *check if prime* process is evaluated for every prime number
candidate, and each time it is evaluated the runtime increases.

It is typically desired to design algorithms that have as short of a
runtime as possible.  Sometimes this calls for designing more intricate
or complicated ones; however, only as long as we are sure that the
complicated algorithm will have a shorter runtime than the basic
algorithm.

Let's take a look at an interesting problem that will help to show the
differences between an algorithm that works and an algorithm that works
and is *efficient*.  Consider a square room and an unlimited number of
identical square tiles.  Can an algorithm be designed to calculate the
number of tiles required to cover the entire floor of the room?

There are several ways that this algorithm can be designed.

- One approach is to lay down tiles in the entire room and then count them.

- Another approach may be to lay down tiles in half of the room, count the
number of tiles used, and then double that number.  

- A third approach may be to lay tiles along one edge of the floor, and
multiply the number of tiles laid by itself (i.e., squaring it to find
the area of the floor).

The following figure shows the three methods, side-by-side.

![](images/Lesson03-10.png){fig-align="center"}

Which solution do you think is the best?  What does *best* mean?  Does it
mean that the algorithm takes less time?  Does it mean that it requires
fewer tiles?  Does it mean that it requires fewer calculations (and is
perhaps less prone to arithmetic errors)?  Is there a solution that does
not require laying down any tiles at all?

Having multiple solutions (or algorithms) to the same problem is a
frequent scenario in computer science.  We have mentioned before that
best is a very subjective measure for an algorithm.  However, there is
still a need to compare algorithms and determine which algorithm is
better.  One of the ways of **quantitatively** (i.e., numerically) comparing
is by using the algorithm's runtime.  Let's take a closer look at some
algorithms that solve the tile laying problem.  For simplicity, we will
assume that both the room and tiles are square in shape (i.e., the
number of tiles required to cover adjacent edges is equal).  Note that
the algorithm steps are numbered, with sub-steps placed within a single
algorithm.

Algorithm 1 (this one covers the entire floor with tiles):
```default
1. set number of tiles currently laid to 0
2. repeat the following steps until the entire floor is covered
    2.1. lay a tile on the floor
    2.2. add one to the number of tiles currently laid
3. the number of tiles currently laid is the number of tiles needed
```

Algorithm 2 (this one covers half of the floor with tiles):
```default
1. set number of tiles currently laid to 0
2. repeat the following steps until half of the floor is covered
    2.1. lay a tile on the floor
    2.2. add one to the number of tiles currently laid
3. multiply the number of tiles currently laid by 2
4. the result is the number of tiles needed
```

Algorithm 3 (this one covers the length of one wall with tiles):
```default
1. set number of tiles currently laid to 0
2. repeat the following steps until one row has been laid
    2.1. lay a tile on the floor
    2.2. add one to the number of tiles currently laid
3. multiply the number of tiles currently laid by itself
4. the result is the number of tiles needed
```

We are now going to figure out which algorithm is better between
Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 3 using their runtime.  Suppose that the room
is 12ft x 12ft and each tile is 1ft x 1ft.  Also assume that it takes 10
seconds to lay each tile.  How long will Algorithm 1 take to be
completely executed?  Since Algorithm 1 calls for tiles to be laid
across the entire room, the 12ft x 12ft room would then require 144
tiles.  Since it takes 10 seconds to lay each tile, it would then take
1,440 seconds to cover the entire room.  This is 24 minutes:

$$ 1,440 sec \times \frac{1 min}{60 sec} = 24 min$$


::: {.callout-note title="Did you know"}
**Dimensional analysis** is a nice way to work through problems with
different units (like minutes and seconds), and that require conversion
across them.  The basic idea is that values can be multiplied by
conversion (or dimensional) units that are expressed as fractions.
Those units can be canceled out if they appear in both the numerator and
denominator.  The example above can be rewritten as follows:

$$ \frac{1,440 sec}{1} \times \frac{1 min}{60 sec} = 24 min$$

The *sec* units in the numerator of the first fraction and the denominator
of the second fraction cancel each other out, thereby leaving *min* as the
final unit.  Here's another example that converts days to seconds:

$$ \frac{1 day}{1} \times \frac{24 hr}{1 day} \times \frac{60 min}{1 hr}
\times \frac{60 sec}{1 min} = 86,400 sec$$

The day, hr, and min units in the numerator and denominator of the
fractions cancel each other out.  The only unit left is sec which, once
the numerators and denominators are multiplied, represent the number of
seconds in one day.
:::

What about Algorithm 3?  This algorithm only calls for laying down tiles
along one edge of the room to make one row.  This means that only 12
tiles will be laid down using this algorithm, a process that would take
120 sec (2 min).  But Algorithm 3 also requires a calculation.  Let's
assume that this calculation takes 60 sec.  The total runtime for
Algorithm 3 is then 120 sec + 60 sec = 180 sec (3 min).

So Algorithm 3 is 21 minutes faster than Algorithm 1 for a 12ft x 12ft
room.  But what happens if the size of the room is changed?  What is the
performance of both algorithms if they were used to tile a room that is
20ft x 20ft, under the same timing assumptions as before?

We find that Algorithm 1 takes approximately 1 hr 7 min:

$$ \frac{400 tiles}{1} \times \frac{10 sec}{1 tile} = 4,000 sec $$
$$ \frac{400 sec}{1} \times \frac{1 sec}{60 sec} \times \frac{1 hr}{60
min} = 1.11 hr $$
$$ \frac{0.11 hr}{1} \times \frac{60 min}{1 hr} = 6.6 min $$
$$ \frac{0.6 min}{1} \times \frac{60 sec}{1 min} = 36 sec $$
