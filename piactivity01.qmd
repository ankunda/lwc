## Introduction

In this activity, you will learn about and assemble the items in your
**Living with Cyber kit**. By the end of today's lesson, you should have
a working computer and be able to navigate and use it as comfortably as
you would your own laptop/computer.

## Main Components of the Kit

In the backpack, you should find the following components.

- A box labeled with LCD Display
- A clear bag of wires and electrical components
- A box labeled `Libre Computer Board` (aka `Le Potato`)
- A box labeled `USB Micro-B Power Supply`
- A keyboard
- A Mouse

## Assembly

### Required Components and their Source:

* From the box labeled **LCD Display** you will need the following
  + The display
  + A bag labeled `3B` that contains the following:
    - an HDMI connector
    - a USB Type-A and Micro USB conector
  + A bag that contains two speakers
  + A bag that contains the following:
    - a small screwdriver
    - two 3D printed legs
  - A bag with:
    - 4 chrome screws, 
    - 4 gold-colored threaded stand offs, and 
    - two black screws

- From the *components* bag:
    - Wifi adapter
    - SD Card

- **Le Potato** from the box labeled `Libre Computer Board`


### Instructions

#### Attaching the Potato

1. Flip the **screen** so that the display is face down. The words
`Pineworks Labs` should be face up and easily read.

2. Identify the 4 silver standoffs near the center of the backside of
the display. Remove the circular, orange-colored stickers from the tops
of each of the four standoffs.

3. Find the 4 gold-colored threaded **standoffs** from the bag
containing the screw driver. Using your hands, screw the gold colored
standoffs into the silver colored standoffs.

4. Place the Potato on top of the stand offs so that the holes align
with the stand offs and the hdmi port on the Potato aligns with the hdmi
port near the center of the display. Attach the potato to the display
with the four silver screws using the screwdriver.

5. Attach the HDMI component labeled **H-3B** and the USB component
labeled **USB-H 3B**

#### Attaching the Legs

6. Attach the display's **legs** as pictured using the black screws.

#### Attaching the Speakers

7. Plug the speakers in. Note the wire colors in the image to assist
with orientation.

8. Remove the paper from the speakers to expose the adhesive areas.
Stick the speakers to the pre-outlined areas.

#### Inserting the SD Card

9. Find the **SD card** from the components bag. Insert the sd card into
the sd card slot on the Potato. The slot is on the underside of the
Potato and opposite the usb ports.

#### Attaching Peripherals

10. Find the **wifi dongle** in the components bag and insert it into an
available usb port

11. Attach the **keyboard** and **mouse** to available USB ports on the Potato.

12. Attach the **power supply** to the micro USB port on the
**display/screen**. Plug the power supply into a wall outlet to boot the
Potato. Wait about 20-30 seconds and the Potato will be ready.


## Wifi

Connecting to a typical WPA2 network (like the one you'd find at home)
should be a straightforward process. However, connecting to an
Enterprise *WPA2 network* like the one on Louisiana Tech's campus is a
little more involved.


1. Open a terminal window from the menu bar at the top of the screen by
clicking the black icon of a with `>_` inside of it.

2. Type the following **exactly** as shown into the terminal and then
hit `Enter` to open a file that contains information about the network 

    ```default
    sudo gedit /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
    ```
::: {.callout-note title="Terminal Tip" .column-margin}
Use the **TAB** key of your keyboard to autocomplete commands or file
names that you are typing into your terminal to save time and avoid any
typos/errors.
:::

::: {.callout-note title="Wifi Tip #1" .column-margin}
**Append** means add the information to the end of the existing file. Do
NOT delete any information that already exists in the file.
:::

3. **Append** the following information to the file that was opened by the
command above. Be sure to replace `abc123` and `GoDogs!` with your
Lousiana Tech credentials.

    ```default
    network={
        ssid="LaTechWPA2"
        key_mgmt=WPA-EAP
        identity="abc123"
        password="GoDogs!"
    }
    ```

::: {.callout-note title="Wifi Tip #2" .column-margin}
A large number of wifi issues stem from students mistyping the text
in steps 2 and 3. Make sure to crosscheck your text before you proceed
to step 4.
:::

4. Save the file and then close it. 

5. Type `reboot` into the terminal and hit `Enter`. This should reboot
your Potato.

6. After your potato has restarted, it should automatically connect to
*LaTech WPA2* and you should be able to access the internet. 

If done correctly, your *potato* will automatically connect to Tech's
network whenever the network is available.

Feel free to explore on your **Potato**. Try out different applications
and see how similar or different it is from your laptop. Suggestions of
applications to look at and try out include:

- Scratch
- Libreoffice Writer
- Libreoffice Calc
- Terminal
- Chromium
