## Machine Language

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Machine language** is a set of specific instructions that can be executed
directly by a computer. This language is typically made up of binary
digits (1s and 0s).
:::

A computer can only understand machine language. Machine language
instructions are entirely made up of binary digits and can be directly
executed by the CPU. Since we have a particularly hard time
understanding 1s and 0s, early programmers assigned a set of mnemonics
to represent machine code instructions so that they would be a bit more
readable. This mapping became known as **assembly language**. People still
write code in assembly language, but it is not typically used to create
large scale applications.

## Programming Languages

The kinds of languages that are widely used today are known as
programming languages. Programming languages allow us to represent
algorithms in a way that is similar to English but is more structured
and much less ambiguous.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **programming language** is a precisely constructed language that is
specifically used to communicate instructions to a computer.
:::

English is a spoken language. As such, it was spoken first, rules were
later defined and written down.  Therefore, there are many exceptions
(i.e., words and phrases that are grammatically correct but don't
conform to the general grammar/spelling rules). Spoken languages are
sometimes ambiguous and open to interpretation. This means that a single
statement can have multiple meanings. For example, the statement “I made
the robot fast” can mean several different things. Does it mean that the
robot was built quickly? Or does it mean that the robot was modified so
that it would move around more quickly than it did before? Perhaps it
means that the robot is named Fast. Or maybe that we managed to make the
robot stop eating nuts and bolts.

Humans rely on external factors like context and body language to
understand the true meaning of a statement in a spoken language. And
even then mistakes in interpretation still happen. With computers
however, we need a language that is so structured and unambiguous that
every computer can understand and interpret a given statement in the
exact same way. For example, we don't want two different computers
giving us two completely different answers to the arithmetic expression
$1 + 1$.  In contrast to spoken languages, programming languages are first
defined with rules. The language itself is then derived from those
rules. Programming languages are therefore quite structured and not
ambiguous. They are very precise and logical.

There are many different programming languages that can be used to
describe an algorithm. One of them, for example, is called Python, and
it is what we will be using for the majority of the Living with Cyber
curriculum. It is the duty of the programmer to write down the tasks
that he/she wants done in a given programming language. Since computers
can only understand machine language, we utilize an application known as
a compiler that translates this programming language into machine
language.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **compiler** is a tool used to translate an algorithm expressed in a
programming language to machine language. The process by which this
conversion from programming language to machine language is done is
called **compilation**.
:::

The compilation process takes an algorithm written in a programming
language and translates it to assembly language. From there, a process
known as linking converts the assembly language to machine language.
This is illustrated by @fig-compilation below:

![The compilation
process](images/Lesson04-01.png){#fig-compilation}

Once machine language is generated to match a program, the computer can
then directly execute the program and implement the algorithm. A fully
compiled language is only executable by a CPU with the same
characteristics and operating system (often, including version) as that
which it was compiled for.  A programmer who wants wide distribution of
his software will need to compile source code to the various destination
computing architectures and operating systems that are the most likely
to be used by the target audience for the application. Of course, the
programmer could simply distribute source code and let users compile
that themselves. Often, however, programmers do not wish to distribute
source code for a variety of reasons (e.g., intellectual property).
@fig-compilation2 below shows how a program would need to be compiled
numerous times to cover a range of target computing architectures and
operating systems:

![The compilation
process needs to be done for different target
architectures](images/Lesson04-02.png){#fig-compilation2}

Not all programming languages are compiled to machine language. Some are
never compiled and are executed, one instruction at a time, by an
**interpreter**.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
An **interpreter** is a tool used to evaluate instructions, written in a
programming language, as the program is executed.
:::

An interpreter can be thought of as a real time compiler that executes
high level programming language instructions, one at a time. Interpreted
languages are much slower to execute than compiled languages.  Examples
of interpreted languages are Python, PHP, JavaScript, and Perl. To
execute a program written in an interpreted language, you must have an
appropriate interpreter installed on your computing system.  Interpreted
languages also require programmers to distribute their source code, and
users to have an appropriate interpreter installed on their system.
Maintaining code privacy is therefore not possible with interpreted
languages.

Partially compiled and interpreted languages combine the convenience of
interpreted languages (i.e., not having to compile source code to a
large number of target machine language executables) and the privacy and
speed of compiled languages (i.e., not having to distribute source
code).

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **hybrid language** is a programming language that is compiled down to an
intermediate language, and then interpreted (while the program is
executed) from there.
:::

Examples of partially compiled languages are Java, Python, and Lisp.
Note that Python can be strictly interpreted or partially compiled
depending on the programmer's preferences. The intermediate language is
distributed and subsequently executed on any computing platform that has
an interpreter for the intermediate language. For example, Java source
code is typically expressed in a *.java* file and partially compiled to
Java bytecodes (in a *.class* file) that can then be distributed. A Java
Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecodes by interpreting each
instruction, one at a time. The benefit of this method is that a
programmer can distribute a single file to everyone, regardless of CPU
architecture and operating system. Anyone wanting to execute the file
simply needs to have a version of the JVM for their computing system.
This is illustrated in @fig-compilation3 below:

![Partially compiled
languages](images/Lesson04-03.png){#fig-compilation3}

## Programming Paradigms

Over the past forty years or so, three general classes, or paradigms, of
programming languages have emerged. These paradigms include the
imperative paradigm, the functional paradigm, and the logical paradigm.
In addition, during the past decade or so these paradigms have been
extended to include object-oriented features. A language is classified
as belonging to a particular paradigm based on the programming features
it supports.

Object-oriented imperative languages are, by far, the most popular type
of programming language. Both Java and C++ (two of the most used
programming languages in industry) are object-oriented imperative
languages. Scratch and Python are imperative languages – although Python
does contains object- oriented attributes, Scratch does not.

The imperative paradigm is based on the idea that a program is a
sequence of commands or instructions (usually called statements) that
the computer is to follow to complete a task. The imperative style of
programming is the oldest, and now with object-oriented extensions,
continues to be far and away the most popular style of programming.

The Living with Cyber curriculum first (and very briefly) utilizes
Scratch as the programming language.  This is quickly followed by
Python. Scratch is not intended to be used to create applications
designed for production systems. That is, it is not a general purpose
programming language. Instead, it is a teaching tool aimed at
simplifying the process of learning to program. Scratch purposefully
omits many features available in other popular programming languages in
order to keep the language from becoming overly complex. This allows you
to focus on the big picture rather than get bogged down in the
complexities inherent in real programming languages and their
development environments.

One way of thinking about writing Scratch programs is to compare it to
programming in a production programming language with training wheels
on. Complex and useful programs can be written in Scratch; however,
there are many things that programmers are allowed to do in production
languages that are not possible (at least not straightforward) in
Scratch. For example, Scratch does not support functions and function
calls directly, nor does it support recursion directly. These terms may
not be familiar right now; however, these restrictions are designed to
help beginning programmers avoid making common mistakes.

General purpose programming languages are more robust, and can (and are)
used in more situations than educational programming languages like
Scratch. Think of it like this: using a programming language like
Scratch is like building a Lego house only using 2x4 Lego pieces. While
it is possible to do so, there is a limitation on what kinds of houses
you can build. Conversely, using more general purpose programming
languages is like building a house with any kind of Lego piece you can
think up in your mind. There are fewer limitations, and the kinds of
houses that you can build are limitless. From this point, we will use
Python as the general purpose programming language in the course.

## Why Python?

You may have heard about other general purpose programming languages:
Java, C, C++, C#, Visual Basic, and so on. So why use Python instead of,
say, Java? In the end, it amounts to the simple idea that, unlike all of
the other general purpose programming languages listed above, Python
allows us to create powerful programs with limited knowledge about
syntax, therefore allowing us to focus on problem solving instead. In a
sense, Python is logical. That is, nothing must be initially taken on
faith (that will ostensibly be explained at a later time). There isn't
any excess baggage that's required in order to begin to write even
simple Python programs.

Recall how, in geometry, the formula for calculating the volume of a
cone was given. At that time, it was simply inexplicable. That is, you
were most likely told to memorize it. It is not until a calculus course
that this formula is actually derived, and how it came to be is fully
explained. Why? Well, it is simply because it requires calculus in order
to do so. Most students taking a geometry course have not yet had
calculus; however, formulas for calculating the volume of various
objects (including a cone) are typical in such a course. The problem, of
course, is that we are told to take it on faith that it, in fact, works
as described. We are told that, how it works and how it was derived,
will be explained at a later time. The problem with this is that it
forces memorization of important material as opposed to a deep
understanding of it (which, in the end, is the goal).

A similar thing actually occurs in a lot of programming languages.
Often, we must memorize syntax that will be explained later. Python is
unique in that it does a pretty good job of taking all of that out by
just being simple. Programming in Python is immediately logical and
explicable.

Take the following simple example of a program that displays the text,
“Programming rules, man!” in various general purpose programming
languages:

```java
// Basic text display program in Java.
public class SimpleProgram
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
	    System.out.println("Programming rules, man!");
    }
}
```

```c
// Basic text display program in C
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    printf("Programming rules, man!\n");
}
```

```cpp
// Basic text display program in C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout << "Programming rules, man!" << endl;
}
```

```cs
//Basic text display program in C#
public class SimpleProgram
{
    public static void Main()
    {
	    System.Console.WriteLine("Programming rules, man!");
    }
}
```

```vb
'Basic text display program in Visual Basic
Module Hello
    Sub Main()
	    MsgBox("Programming rules, man!")
    End Sub
End Module
```

And in Python

```python
print("Programming rules, man!")
```

In all of these examples, compiling and running the programs (or
interpreting them) produces a single line of output text: “Programming
rules, man!” Did you notice that, in all of the examples (except for
Python), there seems to be a good bit of seemingly extra stuff for such
a simple program? There are a lot of words that you may not be familiar
with or immediately understand: *class, public, static, void, main/Main,
#include, printf, cout, namespace, String[], endl, Module, Sub, MsgBox,*
and so on. In fact, the only readable version to a beginner is usually
the one written in Python.  It is pretty evident that the statement
*print("Programming rules, man!")* means to display that string of
characters to the screen (or console).

Python is extremely readable because it has very simple and consistent
syntax. This makes it perfect for beginner programmers. It also forces
good coding practices and style, something that is very important for
beginners (especially when it comes to debugging and/or maintaining
programs). Python has a large set of libraries that provide powerful
functionality to do just about anything. Libraries allow Python
programmers to use all kinds of things that others have created (i.e.,
we don't have to reinvent the wheel). A huge benefit of Python is that
it is platform independent. It doesn't matter what operating system you
use, it is supported with minimal setup and configuration, and there is
no need to deal with dependencies (i.e., other things that are required
in order to just begin to code in Python).

Don't think that, because of its simplicity, Python is therefore not a
powerful language (or perhaps that it doesn't compete with Java or C++).
Python is indeed powerful, and can do everything that other programming
languages can do (e.g., it does support the object-oriented paradigm).
It is based on a few profound ideas (collectively known as [The Zen of
Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) written by Tim Peters)

::: {.callout-note title="Did you know" .column-margin}
The name of the Python programming language is taken from a television
series called *Monty Python's Flying Circus* (and not from the snake).
:::

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Many programmers write their programs in a general purpose programming
language using nothing but a text-based editor (usually a simplistic
one, albeit with useful characteristics such as syntax highlighting). In
fact, some write programs at the command line (in the terminal) using
nothing but a text-based text editor (i.e., without graphical
characteristics). Most programmers, however, use an IDE (Integrated
Development Environment).

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a piece of software that
allows computer programmers to design, execute, and debug computer
programs in an integrated and flexible manner.
:::

On the Raspberry Pi, the IDE used to design Python programs is called
IDLE (which stands for Python's **I**ntegrated **D**eve**L**opment **E**nvironment).
Other IDEs exist for pretty much all of the most used general purpose
programming languages: Eclipse, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, NetBeans,
Dev-C++, Xcode, and so on.  In fact, many of these IDEs support more
than one language (some natively, others by installing additional
plug-ins or modules)!  Here's an image of IDLE with the program shown
earlier implemented (and executed):

![IDLE shell with simple python statement](images/Lesson04-04.png)

On the Raspberry Pi, IDLE can be launched as follows:

![Launching IDLE on the raspberry pi](images/Lesson04-05.png)

Python programs can also be created and executed at the command line (or
terminal).  We do so by launching a terminal and typing **python**, which
brings up the Python shell:

![Launching IDLE in the terminal](images/Lesson04-06.png)

::: {.callout-note title="Did you know" .column-margin}
On computers that have two alternate versions of python installed on
them, you might have to type **python3** as the command to open up a
python shell like the one in the image.
:::

## Scratch vs. Python

Earlier in this lesson, you learned that programs written in a
programming language are either compiled (to machine language so that a
computer can execute them directly) or interpreted,
statement-by-statement (in a sense, you could say that programs written
in interpreted languages are compiled, line-by-line, in real time).
Python is an interpreted language that implements the imperative
paradigm.  That is, programs are designed as a sequence of instructions
(called statements) that can be followed to complete a task.

Let's take a look at a simple program in Scratch and see how it compares
to the same thing in Python:

![Basic Loop structure in Scratch](images/Lesson04-07.png)

What does this program do?  Simply put, it displays the numbers 2, 4, 6,
and 8.  Take a look at the script above.  The variable *n* is initially
set to 1.  A *repeat-until* loop is executed so long as *n* is less than
10 (i.e., 1 through 9).  Each time the body of the loop is executed, the
string “n is now (plus the value of n)” is displayed if *n* is evenly
divisible by 2.  For example, if *n* is 4, then the string **n is now
4** is displayed.  Recall that the *mod* operator returns the remainder
of a division.  Therefore, when **n mod 2 = 0** is true, it means that
the remainder of *n* divided by 2 is zero – so *n* must be even!  At the
end of the body of the loop, the variable *n* is incremented (ensuring
that *n* will eventually reach the value 10, and we will break out of
the *repeat-until* loop).

Here's how this can be similarly done in Python:

```{python}
n = 1
while n < 10:
    if n % 2 == 0:
	    print("n is now " + str(n))
    n = n + 1
```

At this point, it is fine if you don't understand everything that's
going on syntactically.  The idea is simply to illustrate how Scratch
and Python differ (and are similar!).  But let's try to explain. 

- The block, *set n to 1*, in Scratch is implemented in Python as, `n =
1`.  Pretty similar!

- Python has no *repeat-until* repetition construct.  Instead, we can
  use a *while* construct with a modified condition.  Repeating a task
  until a variable (in this case, *n*) is 10 is the same thing as
  repeating it while the variable is less than 10.  

- If-statements are similar; however, the *mod* and *equality* operators
  differ.  In Python, we check for equality using the double-equal (==)
  operator.  The mod operator is a percent sign (%).  So the block, *if
  n mod 2 = 0*, in Scratch can be implemented in Python as, `if n % 2 ==
  0`.

- Generating the output, “n is now 4,” for example, can be implemented
  in Scratch using the familiar print statement: `print ("n is now 4")`.
  Of course, we don't always want to display the literal string "n is 4".  So we
  concatenate (or join) the value of *n* to the string “n is now ” just
  as we did in Scratch.  However, since *n* is not a string of
  characters (i.e., it is a number – an integer to be precise), then it
  must first be converted to a string before being concatenated to
  another string.  This is what `str(n)` does.

- Finally, the value of *n* is incremented by 1 with the statement *n =
  n + 1*.

In Scratch, it is easy to see the blocks that belong in the body of a
repetition construct.  The puzzle pieces intrinsically capture this
(i.e., they are quite literally visible inside the *repeat-until* block in
the script above).  In Python, we denote statement hierarchy (i.e., if
statements belong in the body of a construct such as a *while* loop) by
using **indentation**.  Note how it is quite clear which statements belong
in the body of the *while* loop above: the if-statement and the statement
that increments the variable *n* by 1.  Note that the *print* statement is
inside the true part of the if-statement (this is evident by how it is
directly beneath the if-statement and indented further to the right).
Again, at this point it is fine to have a minimal grasp of Python's
syntax.

## Python Primer
::: {.callout-important title="Activity" collapse=true}
Open your IDE of choice (e.g. IDLE) and follow along with the professor
as they try out different code snippets in the python shell. This
activity should give you an idea of

- the kinds of operators and expressions that are possible  in the
  python shell.

- how to execute print statements consisting of different kinds of data 

- how to prompt the user for some input in the middle of code execution

- storing values in variables

- using variables and the values stored within as part of other
  expressions.
:::

You should be able to understand every single statement in the snippet
below and even create a similar sequence on your own with a clear grasp
of what each statement is doing.

```python
a = 10
b = 15
print(f"{a} ^ {b} = {a**b}")
print(a + 6)
c = input("What is your name?")
print(f"Hello {c}")
d = input(f"so {c}, How old are you?")
e = int(d)
print(f"You are {e} years old and you will be 100 in {100-e} years")
```

### Creating Programs and Saving Files

So far, we have been entering statements in the Python shell.  These
statements have been interpreted, one at a time.  If we were to close
the Python shell, everything that we entered would be lost.  In order to
save Python programs, we must type them in a separate editor outside of
the Python shell, save them in a file.  Once this has been done, we can
then execute them in the Python shell.

To create a new Python program, click on **File | New File** (or press
**Ctrl+N**) in the Python shell.  This brings up a new window (an editor
that is a part of IDLE) in which we can type our program.  Type the
following program into this new window:

```python
a = int(input("Enter a number: "))
b = int(input("Enter another number: "))
print(f"{a} raised to the power {b} is {a**b}")
```

If you are using IDLE, this is what your window should look like.

![Basic python file in IDLE](images/Lesson04-08.png)

::: {.callout-note title="Did you know" .column-margin}
Note that when editing a python file, there will NOT be any **>>>**
symbols on the left of your lines of code. If you see those symbols,
that means you are still within the shell and not in an actual python
file.
:::

Before we can run this program, it must be saved.  Do so by clicking on
**File | Save** (or press **Ctrl+S**).  Give it an appropriate name, and save it
to an appropriate location.  Now it can be executed by clicking on **Run |
Run Module** (or by pressing **F5**).  This executes the program in the Python
shell:

![Code output when python file is run](images/Lesson04-09.png)

You can run your code any number of times by selecting **Run | Run
Module** (or pressing F5). If your code requires some input from the
user, each execution affords you an opportunity to try out different
input options e.g. inputing different numbers to see what one raised to
another is.

### Reloading a saved file

To load a saved Python program, simply double-click on the saved file.
This should bring up the **IDLE** editor with your file loaded in it.
Sometimes, double-clicking on the file just opens it up in a notepad-
like editor by default. To force it to open in IDLE, right-click the
file instead, and select **Open with IDLE**.

The program can then be executed as before, by clicking on **Run | Run
Module** (or by pressing F5). This will automatically open a Python shell
and execute the program.

::: {.callout-important title="Activity" collapse=true}
Write a python program that prompts the user for two numbers and
displays the quotient and remainder when the first number is divided by
the second. As an example, if the user typed in 17 and 3 for the first
and second number respectively, it would output a result similar to the
one shown below.

```{python}
#| echo: false
a = 17
b = 3
print(f"The quotient of {a} divided by {b} is {a//b} with a remainder of {a%b}")
```
:::

### Data types, constants, and variables

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
The kinds of values that can be expressed in a programming language are
known as its **data types**
:::

Recall that Scratch supports only two data types: text and numbers.
Since Python is a general purpose programming language, it supports many
more data types. Actually, it can support virtually any type that you
can think of! That is, Python allows you to define your own type for use
in whatever way you wish. Since this is user-defined, let's focus on
what are called primitive types for now.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
The **primitive types** of a programming language are those data types that
are built-in (or standard) to the language and typically considered as
basic building blocks (i.e., more complex types can be created from
these primitive types).
:::

Python's standard types can be grouped into several classes: numeric
types, sequences, sets, and mappings. Although there are actually
others, we will focus on these in the *Living with Cyber* curriculum.

Numeric types include whole numbers, floating point numbers, and complex
numbers. Python has two whole number types: `int` and `long`. The `int` data
type is a 64-bit integer. This means that 64 bits (i.e. a bit can be
either 0 or 1) is used to represent a single whole number. For example
the following series of bits represent a single integer (in fact it
represents the number 846,251,337): 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
0000 0011 0010 0111 0000 1100 0101 0100 1001. We will explore this in
more detail at a later time. The `long` data type is an integer of
unlimited length. This means Python will give us enough bits to store
any number we want! Note that in Python 3.x, an `int` is an integer of
unlimited length (there is no long data type). These integer types can
represent negative or positive whole numbers. The `float` type is a 64-bit
floating point (decimal) number. This means it can hold numbers like
3.14 and -90.3324235. Lastly, the `complex` type represents complex
numbers (i.e., numbers with real and imaginary parts). Most of our
programs will require only `int` and `float`.

So what does this all mean? We create variables that contain data of
some data type. Knowing the data type of a variable is like knowing the
superpowers of a person you can control. In this analogy, the
superpowers of a data type are the methods and properties that can be
leveraged for use in whatever program you are writing at the time. For
example, one of the superpowers of the numeric data types is raising
them to a power. To do that, we can use the function of the form
`pow(x,y)`. In this example, *x* and *y* are variables that are of type
`int` or
`float`. The **pow** function returns the value of the computation involving
raising the value in x to the power of the value in y (i.e., x^y^ ). This
function would not typically be able to work for variables that aren't
numeric data types. You may recall that the same functionality can be
implemented in Python as: `x ** y`. This effectively performs the same
thing.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **constant** is defined as a value of a particular type that does not
change over time.
:::

In Python (just as in Scratch), both numbers and text may be expressed
as constants. **Numeric constants** are composed of the digits 0 through
9 and, optionally, a negative sign (for negative numbers), and a decimal
point (for floating point numbers). For example, the number -3.14159 is
a numeric constant in Python.

A text constant consists of a sequence of characters (also known as a
string of characters – or just a string). The following are examples of
valid string constants:

- “A man, a plan, a canal, Panama.”
- “Was it Eliot's toilet I saw?”
- “There are 10 kinds of people in this world. Those who know binary,
  those who don't, and those who didn't know it was in base 3!”

Note that, unlike Scratch, Python requires the quotes surrounding text
constants.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **variable** is a named object that can store a value of a particular
data type.
:::

Recall that Scratch supports two types of variables: text variables and
numeric variables. Moreover, before a variable can be used, its name
must be declared. In many programming languages, both its name and type
must be declared; however, both Scratch and Python only require a
variable's name to be declared before it is used. Here is an example of
declaring and initializing a variable in Python compared to the process
in Scratch.

:::{layout-ncol=2}

![](images/Lesson04-10.png)

```{python}
age = 19
```

:::



Here are some examples that deal with variables and how they compare in
Scratch and Python:

:::{layout-ncol=2}

![](images/Lesson04-11.png)

```{python}
age = 19
age = age + 1
age = age + 1
if (age > 35):
    print("You are old.")
else:
    print("Young'n!")
```

![](images/Lesson04-12.png)

```{python}
num1 = 35
num2 = 69
avg = (num1 + num2) / 2.0
print(avg)
```
:::

In short, to declare variables in Python, we simply write a statement
that assigns a value to a variable name. Note that, just as in Scratch,
we can assign a value of a different type to a variable. For example:

```{python}
var = 5
print(var)
var = 3.14159
print(var)
var = "Pi"
print(var)
```

It is important to realize that, while human programmers generally try
to give variables names that reflect the use to which they will be put,
the variable name itself doesn’t mean anything to the computer.  For
example, the numeric variable `age` can be used to hold any number, not
just an age. It is perfectly legal for `age` to hold the number of
students in a class or the number of eggs in your refrigerator. The
computer couldn’t care less. Human programmers, on the other hand,
generally care a great deal. They expect a variable’s name to accurately
reflect its purpose; so while it is possible to do so, it would be
considered poor programming practice to use the variable `age` to store
anything other than an age.

### Input and Output

In order for a computer program to perform any useful work, it must be
able to communicate with the outside world. The process of communicating
with the outside world is known as input/output (or I/O).  Most
imperative languages include mechanisms for performing other kinds of
I/O such as detecting where the mouse is pointing and accessing the
contents of a disk drive.

The flexibility and power that input statements give programming
languages cannot be overstated.  Without them the only way to get a
program to change its output would be to modify the program code itself,
which is something that a typical user cannot be expected to do.

General-purpose programming languages allow human programmers to
construct programs that do amazing things. When attempting to understand
what a program does, however, it is vitally important to always keep in
mind that the computer does not comprehend the meaning of the character
strings it manipulates or the significance of the calculations it
performs. Take, for example, the following simple Scratch program:

![](images/Lesson04-13.png)

This program simply displays strings of characters, stores user input,
and echoes that input back to the screen along with some additional
character strings. The computer has no clue what the text string “Please
enter your name: ” means. For all it cares, the string could have been
“My hovercraft is full of eels.” or “qwerty uiop asdf ghjkl;” (or any
other text string for that matter). Its only concern is to copy the
characters of the text string onto the display screen.

Only in the minds of human beings do the sequence of characters “Please
enter your name: ” take on meaning. If this seems odd, try to remember
that comprehension does not even occur in the minds of all humans, only
those who are capable of reading and understanding written English. A
four year old, for example, would not know how to respond to this prompt
because he or she would be unable to read it.  This is so despite the
fact that if you were to ask the child his or her name, he or she could
immediately respond and perhaps even type it out on the keyboard for
you.

Now consider this Scratch program:

![](images/Lesson04-14.png)

Here, the input is numeric instead of text. The program prompts the user
for two numbers, which it then computes the sum for and displays to the
user. Note that two variables were declared: `num1` and `num2`.  The
first number is captured and stored in the variable `num1`. The
second number is captured and stored in the variable `num2`. What do
you think would happen if the user did not provide numeric input
and, for example, inputted “Bob” for the first number? In the *real
world*, programmers must create robust programs that examine user
input in order to verify that it is of the proper type before
processing that input. If the input is found to be in error, the
program must take appropriate corrective action, such as rejecting
the invalid input and requesting the user try again.

In Python, output is implemented as a **print** statement: 

```python
print("This is some output!")
```

We use the **input** statement to ask a question and obtain user input.
In the same statement, we can assign the result of this to a variable:

```python
age = int(input("How old are you? "))
```

Of course, we need to take care to properly specify whether the input is
numeric or text (in Python 3.x its a text by default. Use casting to
convert into numeric).

### Expressions and assignment

You've seen how to assign values to variables above using a simple
assignment statement. For example:

```python
name = "Shonda Lear"
age = 19
grade = 91.76
letter_grade = "A"
```

These are all examples of assignment statements. In this configuration,
the equal sign (=) functions as the assignment operator. Later, you will
see how it can also be used to compare values or expressions.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
An **expression** in a programming language is some combination of
values (e.g., constants and variables) that are evaluated to produce
some new value.
:::

For example, a simple expression in Python is `1 + 2`. The result of this
expression is, of course, `3`!  Expressions usually take on the form of
*operand operator operand*. In the previous example, the operator was
`+` and the operands were `1` and `2`. The operator `+` has a very well defined
behavior on operands of numeric types: it simply adds them. On string
types, it concatenates. 

::: {.callout-important title="Activity" collapse=true}
What do you think would happen if the operands are of two different
types (e.g., numeric and string)? Try out the statements below and see
if you can understand the output that you get.
```python
print(1 + "one")
print("one" + 1)
print("1" + "1")
print(1 + "1")
print(1 + 1)
print("one" + str(1))
print(1 + int("1"))
```
:::

The activity above should have demonstrated that Python doesn't know
what it means to “add” a numeric type to a string type. Therefore, it
results in an error: unsupported operand type(s). To “add” a string type
to a numeric type, we must convert the numeric type to a string type via
`str`. Then, Python understands that “adding” actually means concatenating
two strings. It is interesting to note how Python handles “multiplying”
a string type and a numeric type like this:

```{python}
print("hello" * 5)
```

It turns out that Python understands how to “multiply” both types by
interpreting the `*` operator as concatenating a string type a number of
times specified by a numeric type.

```{python}
print("Baby Shark")
print("doo " * 6)
```

Python has many different operators that perform a variety of operations
on operands. These will be discussed later in this lesson.

## Subprograms

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **subprogram** is a block or segment of organized, reusable, and related
statements that perform some action.
:::

It is essentially a program within a program. Recall an earlier lesson
on representing algorithms as to-do lists. One algorithm represented the
steps necessary to *get to class*. One of those steps was *eat
breakfast*.  We noted how we could zoom in to that step and identify the
sub-steps necessary to complete the *eat breakfast* step. Control flow
shifted from the main to-do list to the *eat breakfast* to-do list when
the *eat breakfast* step was encountered, and then returned to the main
to-do list at the point where it left earlier. We can consider the *eat
breakfast* to-do list as a subprogram.

Very few *real* programs are written as one long piece of code. Instead,
traditional imperative programs generally consist of large numbers of
relatively simple subprograms that work together to accomplish some
complex task. While it is theoretically possible to write large programs
without the use of subprograms, as a practical matter any significant
program must be decomposed into manageable pieces if humans are to write
and maintain it.

Subprograms make the construction of software libraries possible.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **software library** (or just **library**) is a collection of subprograms, or
routines as they are sometimes called, for solving common problems that
have been written, tested, and debugged.
:::

Most programming languages come with extensive libraries for performing
mathematical and text string operations and for building graphical user
interfaces. These languages allow programmers to include library
routines in their code. Using subprograms from the library speeds up the
software development process and results in a more reliable finished
product.

When a subprogram is invoked, or called, from within a program, the
*calling* program pauses temporarily so that the *called* subprogram can
carry out its actions. Eventually, the called subprogram will complete
its task and control will once again return to the *caller*. When this
occurs, the calling program *wakes up* and resumes its execution from the
point it was at when the call took place.

Subprograms can call other subprograms (including copies of themselves
as we will see later). These subprograms can, in turn, call other
subprograms. This chain of subprogram invocations can extend to an
arbitrary depth as long as the *bottom* of the chain is eventually
reached. It is necessary that infinite calling sequences be avoided,
since each subprogram in the chain of subprogram invocations must
eventually complete its task and return control to the program that
called it.

Subprograms are broken down into two types: methods and functions.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **method** is a subprogram that performs an action and returns flow of
control to the point at which it was called. A **function** is similar;
however, it returns some sort of value before flow of control is
transferred back to the point at which it was called.
:::

For example, a method may simply display some useful information about a
program to the user (e.g., a program's help menu), while a function may
compute some numeric value and return it to the user.  Subprograms in
Python are generally just referred to as functions, regardless of
whether or not they return a value. For the remainder of this lesson, we
will refer to subprograms as functions.

In Python, functions must formally be declared prior to their use. That
is, the body or content of a function must be specified in a program
before it can be called. The syntax for declaring a function is as
follows:

```python
def function_name(optional_parameters):
    function_body
```

The keyword **def** is a reserved word in Python and is used to declare
functions. A function name can be any valid identifier. As you will see
later, an **identifier** is a name used to identify a variable, function, or
other object (note that objects will be discussed later). The function
name must be followed by a set of parentheses containing optional
parameters.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Parameters** allow for values (constants, variables, expressions, and so
on) to be passed in to a function. They form the input needed for the
function to execute properly.
:::

For example, a function may accept two values, calculate their average,
and return the result to the caller. The function **definition** (or
**header**) is terminated with a colon (`:`). The **body** of a function
(i.e., its enclosed statements) is indented.

Here is an example of a simple function that displays a line of text:

```{python}
def sayHelloWorld():
    print("Hello World!")
```

This function is called `sayHelloWorld` and takes no parameters. It simply displays the text, “Hello
world!”

Once its been defined, we can then progress to using this function as
many times as we'd like. To call this function, we simply need to
specify its name and the values of its parameters (if any) as follows:

```{python}
sayHelloWorld()
```

Or if we want to call it multiple times:

```{python}
sayHelloWorld()
sayHelloWorld()
sayHelloWorld()
```

Formally, functions have a **header** and a **body**. The header is the
statement that defines the function (i.e., with the def keyword). The
header of a function is often called its **signature**, and provides its
name and any parameters. Function parameters help a function complete
its task by providing input values. In fact, each call to a function
possibly means a new set of parameters. The body of a function describes
what the function does. This is the code within the function. Some
functions compute and return a result, called the **return value**, that is
returned via the **return** keyword.

Here's a function that accepts two parameters and calculates (and
returns) the average of the two:

```{python}
def average(a, b):
    return (a + b) / 2
```

And here are some examples of how it could be called:

```{python}
a = average(5, 11)
b = average(4, 6)
c = average(22, 21)
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
```

Note the **return** keyword. Its purpose is to return whatever
expression comes after it. The statement `return (a + b) / 2` returns
the result of the expression `(a + b) / 2` to the caller (one of which
happened at the statement `average(5, 11)`).

Here's a pow function that returns the exponentiation of one parameter
by another:

```{python}
def pow(x, y):
    return x ** y
```

Recall that `x ** y` in Python implies exponentiation and means *x*
raised to the power *y*. Formally, we call `**` the exponentiation
operator.  Operators will be discussed in detail in the next section.  

Here's sample output of this function with various parameters:

```{python}
a = pow(2, 8)
b = pow(10, 4)
c = pow(3, 5)
print(f"a = {a}, b = {b}, c = {c}")
```

## Operators

Like Scratch, Python has a variety of operators, broken down into
several classes: arithmetic operators, relational (comparison)
operators, assignment operators, logical operators, bitwise operators,
membership operators, and identity operators. Operators allow operations
to be performed on operands.  Let's first take a look at the arithmetic
operators since they relate directly to assignment.

### Arithmetic Operators

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Arithmetic operators** allow us to perform arithmetic operations on
two operands.
:::

In the following table, assume that `a = 23`, `b = 17`, `c = 4.0`, and
`d = 8.0`:

| Symbol | Description | Example 1| Example 2 |
|--|:----|:--------|:------|
| `+`| addition | a + b = 40 | c + d = 12.0 |
| `-`| subtraction |a - b = 6 | c - d = -4.0 |
| `*`| multiplication | a * b = 391|c * d = 32.0 |
| `/`| division | a / b = 1.3529411764705883 |c / d = 0.5|
| `%`| modulus |a % b = 6 |c % d = 4.0 |
| `**`| exponentiation |a ** b = 141050039560662968926103 |c ** d = 65536.0 |
| `//`| floor division|a // b = 1 |c // d = 0.0|

: Python Arithmetic Operators and Examples

```{python}
c = 4.0
d = 8.0
print(c + d)
print(c - d)
print(c * d)
print(c / d)
print(c % d)
print(c ** d)
print(c // d)
```

### Relational Operators

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Relational operators** allow us to compare the values of two operands.
:::

The result is the relation among the operands. In the following table,
assume that `a = 23` and `b = 17`:

| Symbol | Description | Example |
|---|:-----|:-------|
|`==`| equality | `a == b` is `False`|
|`!=`| inequality | `a != b` is `True`|
|`<>`| inequality | `a <> b` is `True`|
|`>`| greater than | `a > b` is `True`|
|`>=`| greater than or equal to | `a >= b` is `True`|
|`<`| less than | `a < b` is `False`|
|`<=`| less than or equal to | `a <= b` is `False`|

: Python Relational Operators and Examples

Note that the capitalization of `True` and `False` is intentional. In
Python, the boolean value *true* is expressed as `True` and *false* as
`False`.
Also note that the use of `<>` is mostly discouraged as this is an old
style way of checking for inequality. It is therefore recommended to use
`!=` instead.

```{python}
a = 23
b = 17
print(a == b)
print(a != b)
print(a > b)
print(a >= b)
print(a < b)
print(a <= b)
```

In Python, relational operators are typically used in if-statements,
where branching is often desired. This will be illustrated in more
detail later.

### Assignment Operators

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Assignment operators** allow us to assign values to variables.
:::

You have already seen the most basic example of this using the equal
assignment operator (as in the statement: `age = 19`). In the following
table, assume that `a = 23.0` and `b = 17`:

| Symbol | Expression | Description | Result |
|-|:--|:------------|:-----|
|`=`|`a = b`| assigns the value in `b` to `a` | a = 17 |
|`+=`|`a += b`| increments the value in `a` by `b` (same as `a = a + b`) | a = 40.0 |
|`-=`|`a -= b`| decrements the value in `a` by `b` (same as `a = a - b`) | a = 6.0 |
|`*=`|`a *= b`| increases the value in `a` by a factor of `b` (same as `a = a * b`) | a = 391.0 |
|`/=`|`a /= b`| decreases the value in `a` by a factor of `b` (same as `a = a / b`) | a = 1.3529411764705883 |
|`%=`|`a %= b`| changes the value in `a` to the remainder of dividing `a` by `b` (same as `a = a % b`) | a = 6.0 |
|`**=`|`a **= b`| changes the value in `a` to the exponentiation of `a` to `b` (same as `a = a ** b`) | a = 1.4105003956066297e+23 |
|`//=`|`a //= b`| changes the value in `a` the floor of dividing `a` by `b` (same as `a = a // b`) | a = 1.0 |

: Python Assignment Operators and Examples

## Identifiers and Reserved Words

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
An **identifier** is a name used to identify a variable, function, or other
object (note that objects will be discussed later).
:::

Variable names (such as `age` and `average`, for example) or function
names (such as `midPoint` and `distance`, for example) are all valid
identifiers.

In Python, identifiers must begin with a letter (either lowercase `a` to
`z` or uppercase `A` to `Z`) or an
underscore (\_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 through 9). Here are
examples of valid identifiers:

```python
average
Average
average_grade
averageScore
_mustard
_7a69_
a1b2c3X7Y9Z0
```

Note that Python is a case-sensitive language. For example, the
identifier `average` is not the same as the identifier `Average`. Take a
look at this example:

```{python}
average = 100
Average = 50
print(f"average = {average}")
print(f"Average = {Average}")
```

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Reserved words** (sometimes called **keywords**) in a programming language are
words that are meaningful to the language and **cannot** be used as
identifiers.
:::

Most programming languages have quite a few reserved words. Python 3.x,
for example, has the following reserved words:

```{python}
#| echo: false
from keyword import kwlist
reservedwords = kwlist
for i in range(len(reservedwords)):
    print(f"{reservedwords[i]}, ", end = "")
    if (i % 12 == 11):
        print()
```

You are already familiar with some of these: `def`, `print`, and
`return`.  Many of the Python reserved words will be discussed later.

## Comments

It is often useful to provide informative text in our programs.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
A **comment** is text that is not interpreted nor converted to some sort of
executable format as typical source code may be. It simply exists to
provide information to developers, coders, or users working on or
inspecting source code.
:::

We often comment parts of programs to describe what something does, why
a choice in construct was chosen, and so on. Typically, a header at the
top of our programs is also inserted to provide information such as who
authored the program, when it was last updated, and what it does.

In Python, there are two kinds of comments: single- and multi-line
comments. Although there are several ways of commenting, we will only
discuss the more widely used methods.

Single-line comments span a single line (or a part of a line). A single
line comment begins with the pound or hash (for the Twitter/X crowd) sign:
`#`. A single-line comments can take up the entire line (i.e., the line
begins with `#`), or it can follow a valid Python statement (i.e., only
the latter part of a line is commented). Here are sample single-line
comments:

```python
# get the user's name
name = input("What is your name? ")
name = "Dr. " + name	# prepend the Dr. title

# say hello!
print(f"Hello {name}!")
```

In the snippet above, there are three single-line comments. Two each
take up an entire line. The third takes up only part of the line. The
text that comes before it is valid Python syntax that is interpreted.
Note that, once a comment has been started on a line, the rest of the
line must be a comment.

Multi-line comments begin and end with three single (`'''`) or double
quotes (`"""`)in succession. They are typically used in source code
headers, to comment out blocks of code for reasons such as debugging,
and so on.  Here are sample multi-line comments:

```python
"""
Author: Manny McFarlane
Last updated: 2023-12-19
Description: This program is nothing but fluff.
"""
'''
And
here
is
another
multi-line
comment!
'''
""" This is also a valid
multi-line comment """
''' And so is this! '''
```

Note that single and double quotes cannot be mixed in multi-line
comments. That is, a multi-line comment cannot start with three single
quotes and end with three double quotes. Many Python programmers prefer
to implement multi-line comments as a sequence of single-line comments;
for example:

```python
# Author: Manny McFarlane
# Last updated: 2023-12-19
# Description: This program is nothing but fluff.
```

This often stems from the fact that, in Python, strings can be enclosed
in single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or three successive single
(`'''`) or double (`"""`) quotes. The latter allows strings to span
multiple lines. For example:

```{python}
first_name = 'Joe'
last_name = "Smith"
bio = """I am a wonderful human being
capable of truly incredible things!"""

print(first_name)
print(last_name)
print(bio)
```

Specifically regarding program headers, many programmers choose to
implement them as follows to make them readable and easily identifiable:

```python
#################################################
# Author: Manny McFarlane
# Last updated: 2023-12-19
# Description: This program is nothing but fluff.
#################################################
```

## Primary Control Constructs

What makes computers more than simple calculating devices is their
ability to respond in different ways to different situations. In order
to create programs capable of solving more complex tasks we need to
examine how the basic instructions we have studied can be organized into
higher-level constructs.  Recall that the vast majority of imperative
programming languages support three types of control constructs which
are used to group individual statements together and specify the
conditions under which they will be executed. Again, these control
constructs are: sequence, selection, and repetition.

Recall from a previous RPi activity that **sequence** requires that the
individual statements of a program be executed one after another, in the
order that they appear in the program. Sequence is defined implicitly by
the physical order of the statements. It does not require an explicit
program structure. This is related to our previous discussion on
**control flow**.

::: {.callout-tip title="Definition"}
**Selection** constructs contain one or more blocks of statements and
specify the conditions under which the blocks should be executed.
:::
